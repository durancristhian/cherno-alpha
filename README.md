***(FINISHED)*** :elephant: ToDo list built with AngularJS, ngAnimate, express and jade

## Development

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Uploading changes

## ToDo list

- [X] ~~Preparing the ground: Compile home.jade to static html. That would allow me to push the ```./app``` directory to gh-pages~~
- [X] ~~Going live: modify the build process (new gulp task + npm script) and publish to gh-pages~~
